# Food Order WebApp
Simple food ordering WebApp that I created in a couple of hours for a friend that organized a small event.

## Functionality

It allows users to create a order for a burger by selecting within a list of ingredients. Then they input a name so that they can be called when the order is ready.

The cook can login into the dashboard to see all of the orders and delete them when he done preparing one.

## Technologies used
- Python as backend. 
- Flask as framework. 
- Jinja2 as templating engine.
- MongoDB as database.
